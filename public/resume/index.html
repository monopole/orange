<p>Software Engineer</p>
<p>Problems I solved</p>
<h2 id="open-source-kubernetes-cluster-management">open source kubernetes cluster management</h2>
<p>2017 Mar - present</p>
<p>The two problems here were</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Managing the dozens or possibly thousands of variants
of the desired state of a cluster or set of clusters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leading an open source project from nothing to 6500
github stars and over 100 contributors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a kubernetes cluster, one <em>declares</em> the
state of all cluster objects in files, then applies
those files to the cluster.  To edit the cluster one
edits these files and reapplies them.</p>
<p>This creates a new problem: how to manage these edits.</p>
<p>kustomize solves this somewhat recursively by declaring
the edits themselves as kubernetes objects.</p>
<p>Kustomize is used by Google and other hundreds of other
companies to manage their cluster variants.</p>
<p>I founded and led the project.</p>
<h2 id="satellite-control">satellite control</h2>
<p>Worked on problems in satellite management</p>
<ul>
<li>Conversion of optimization solutions for communication and image capture to satellite commands.</li>
<li>Conversion of orbitology software (TLE to orbital states computation) to Google systems.</li>
<li>Development cycle for the above, including deployment, rollbacks, and requirements
collection from the flight teams.</li>
</ul>
<p>Worked for one year on this (~2016), before sale of Terrabella to Planet Labs.</p>
<h2 id="secure-distributed-computing">secure, distributed computing</h2>
<p>Problem: How can distributed servers find each other,
securely communicate, and delegate authority.</p>
<p>This project was a predecessor to <a href="https://kubernetes.io">kubernetes</a> and
Google fuchsia.</p>
<p>It required building libraries for service construction
and discovery, a <a href="https://grpc.io">grpc</a>-like service and protobuffer
language, and a wonderful model of delegatable
authorization based on public-key cryptography.</p>
<p>I contributed to the libraries and overall project
organization, wrote extensive, tested <a href="https://vanadium.github.io/tutorials/hello-world.html">tutorials</a>, and
built demos for android, ios and X11.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/monopole/volley">volley</a>, a distributed openGL app for
iOS, android, osX, X11 in Go that demonstrates
vanadium&rsquo;s cross platform power (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk-5BkO_P14">video</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/vanadium/java/tree/master/projects/moments">moments</a>, an android photo sharing app
demonstrating vanadium services, authentication and
discovery.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To test the tutorials I wrote a literate programming
system to read markdown, extract fenced code blocks,
execute them and report errors ([mdrip]).  mdrip is
used to test <a href="https://googlecontainertools.github.io/kpt">kpt</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize">kustomize</a> and other tools.</p>
<p>Work was awarded with various internal mechanisms.</p>
<p>It was an honor to work with a team including Dave
Presotto and Ken Thompson, building the first large
system based on Pike&rsquo;s Go.</p>
<p>Investment in open-source Vanadium was halted in
favor of <a href="https://fuchsia.dev">fuchsia</a>.  I moved to terrabella.</p>
<p>Time: 2014 July - 2016 Feb</p>
<h2 id="monetized-hangouts--google-via-human">monetized hangouts / google via human</h2>
<p>Problem: How can Google literally connect a query to an expert?</p>
<p>Google helpouts was Google&rsquo;s attempt to turn video chat
into a business platform.  If a Google query for <em>How
to fix a toilet leak?</em> failed, it could connect you to
an actual human plumber who&rsquo;d talk to you and walk you
through the repair on a paid tutorial platform.</p>
<p>I worked on the android app, the internal stack serving
its API, integration with Google search, and the
referral system.</p>
<p>This project offered piano lessons, cooking, vacation
advice and medical services in one app.  All of this in
one UX was <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/02/15/helpouts-r-i-p-googles-build-it-and-they-will-come-approach-ultimately-failed-health-practitioners">too muddled</a> and new for both the
consumers and the providers.  <a href="https://www.onemedical.com">One-medical</a> is an
example of how to do this well in one vertical.
Imagine mixing this with piano lessons.  Our overall
plan was arrogant.</p>
<p>Awarded spot bonus for the Helpouts launch.</p>
<p>Time: 2013 Jan - 2014 June</p>

<p>Problem: Safely offer 3rd party games on Google web platform</p>
<h2 id="ballistic-missile-defense-ux">ballistic missile defense UX</h2>
<pre><code>2005 Lincoln Laboratories  / Group 33 Lexington MA

  * Managed team that built two cornerstone apps for the Reagan Test
    Site. The first gathered sensor (radar, optical, etc.) data from
    the network and presented it in ~30 different widgets (e.g.,
    a radar bore-site view of incoming objects).  The second app was a
    simulator.  It allowed someone to set up a missile attack
    and create simulated sensors operating in the scenario.  The
    simulated sensors emit data to the network to exercise displays
    and other system components (database recorder, safety systems,
    etc.). The simulator is central to operator training, as human
    operators control the simulated sensors as they would real
    sensors.

  * Set up iterative test and release cycles new to Lincoln.
    New tested versions of the apps are deployed every two weeks to
    the Reagan Test Site in Kwajalein, rather than once or twice a
    year at unpredictable times.

  * Both applications based on the Eclipse Rich Client Platform (ERCP)
    and SWT, capable of running on either Linux or Windows.  Each
    &quot;display&quot; is an ERCP view.  Infected four other Lincoln groups
    with ERCP technology.

<h2 id="2003-founding-employee-of-eidogen-inc-pasadena-ca">2003 Founding employee of Eidogen Inc., Pasadena CA</h2>
<pre><code>  Eidogen was a software-based biotechnology startup out of
  Caltech, offering the world's largest database of protein structure
  and binding site data, along with tools to exploit it.  Company has
  since merged with Sertanty to form &lt;a
  href=&quot;http://www.eidogen-sertanty.com&quot;&gt;eidogen-sertanty&lt;/a&gt;.

  * Built the product division, including recruitment and management
    of ten software engineers (BS thru PhD), an agile/XP coach, a two
    person QA/analyst team and a sysadmin.

  * Led development of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eidogen.com/products.php&quot;&gt;eve&lt;/a&gt;,
    a proteomics visualization tool based on Java
    and Java3d.  Allows a user to manipulate proteins simultaneously
    in a 3D physical space and a 1D sequence space, highlighting
    predicted binding sites, sections of conserved sequence, etc.
    Used quaternion dynamics, dynamic progamming, etc.

  * Helped build a proteomics calculation server called &lt;em&gt;tip&lt;/em&gt; - a
    patent-pending, multi-hosted calculation engine with OODB-based
    object persistence (a mini-borg).  The server pulls data and
    calculation instructions off a prioritized job queue, performs
    calculations using multiple computers, and makes results available
    via the DB and java RMI.  Raw data and the results of lengthy
    calculations are stored in an object-oriented database devoted to
    the server.  Some calculations are simply queries on this data,
    other use incoming data and the existing database to create
    results that further enrich the database with new structures and
    binding sites.

  * Extensive use of Java platform (Swing, Java3d, JDO, JMX, JNI,
    XMLC).  Also leaned on Eclipse, Ruby, XML/Castor, XMLC.

  * Built development environment from the ground up: release
    planning, two week iterations, upfront estimation with customer,
    measurements feeding back into planning, test driven development,
    pair programming, refactoring, etc.

  * Budgeted, selected and helped install initial company hardware and
    software infrastructure (forty+ linux boxen, solaris boxes,
    versant DB, wiki, source control, etc.)
