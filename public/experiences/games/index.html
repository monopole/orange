  <h1> G&#43; Games </h1>
  <p><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/games-in-google-fun-that-fits-your.html">Google+ Games</a> launched when FarmVille was in its prime.</p>
<p>I was TLM of 5-10 swe/qa/interns, coordinating with
extended team of dozens engaged in various aspects of
G+ (stream, auth, privacy, and api).</p>
<p>We built the most complex part of the G+ web client,
as it had to mitigate the risk of allowing 3rd party
apps to run on Google domains.
To do so, we launched the first aspect of the G+ API to
games developers (contact sharing), preceding what
came second (activity  stream listing) by over a year.
We also launched the first use of <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth2</a> at Google.</p>
