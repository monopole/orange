      <description>The two problems here were
  Managing the dozens or possibly thousands of variants of the desired state of a cluster or set of clusters.
  Leading an open source project from nothing to 6500 github stars and over 100 contributors.
  To create a kubernetes cluster, one declares the state of all cluster objects in files, then applies those files to the cluster. To edit the cluster one edits these files and reapplies them.</description>

      <description>Problem: How can distributed servers find each other, securely communicate, and delegate authority.
This project was a predecessor to kubernetes and Google fuchsia.
It required building libraries for service construction and discovery, a grpc-like service and protobuffer language, and a wonderful model of delegatable authorization based on public-key cryptography.
I contributed to the libraries and overall project organization, wrote extensive, tested tutorials, and built demos for android, ios and X11.</description>

      <description>Problem: How can Google literally connect a query to an expert?
Google helpouts was Google&amp;rsquo;s attempt to turn video chat into a business platform. If a Google query for How to fix a toilet leak? failed, it could connect you to an actual human plumber who&amp;rsquo;d talk to you and walk you through the repair on a paid tutorial platform.
I worked on the android app, the internal stack serving its API, integration with Google search, and the referral system.</description>

      <description>Managed team that built two cornerstone apps for the Reagan Test Site. The first gathered sensor (radar, optical, etc.) data from the network and presented it in ~30 different widgets (e.g., a radar bore-site view of incoming objects). The second app was a simulator to drive the displays for training.
Set up iterative test and release cycles new to Lincoln. New tested versions of the apps are deployed every two weeks to the Reagan Test Site in Kwajalein, rather than once or twice a year at unpredictable times.</description>
