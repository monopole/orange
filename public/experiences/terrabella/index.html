  <h1> Terra Bella </h1>
  <p><a href="https://www.planet.com/terrabella">Terra Bella</a> (now <a href="https://www.planet.com">Planet</a>) is a satellite-based Earth imaging service.</p>
<p>I joined Terra Bella (formerly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/08/google-renames-its-satellite-startup-skybox-imaging-to-terra-bella-and-adds-focus-on-image-analysis/">Skybox</a>) after its acquisition by
Google.  I owned a Java-based service that produced a satellite
command stream based on constraints around imaging and comms
opportunities. I also worked on integrating commercial TLE propagation
code into Google systems.  I worked to improve CI/CD, support
rollbacks, conduct post-mortems, etc.</p>
<p>Seeing SkySats 4-7 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je47zL4H1NI">launch</a> with the team, and later accept our
commands, was a highlight.  After a year of integration work, Google
<a href="https://spacenews.com/planet-confirms-google-stake-as-terra-bella-deal-closes">sold Terra Bella</a> to <a href="https://www.planet.com">Planet</a>.</p>
