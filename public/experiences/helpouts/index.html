  <h1> Helpouts </h1>
  <p><a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-launches-helpouts-help-over-live-video-176039">Google Helpouts</a> was Google&rsquo;s attempt to turn
video chat into a small business platform.
If a Google query (<em>How to fix a leaking toilet?</em>) failed,
Google could offer the user a chance to buy time with
a human expert, anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>I worked on the android app and the API it talked to,
arranged for consumer and provider notifications, and
did integration with Google search.</p>
<p>This project offered piano lessons, cooking, vacation
advice and medical services in one app.  All of this in
one UX was <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/02/15/helpouts-r-i-p-googles-build-it-and-they-will-come-approach-ultimately-failed-health-practitioners">too broad</a> and new for both the
consumers and the providers.  <a href="https://www.onemedical.com">One-medical</a> is an
example of how to do this well in one vertical.
It would have been wildly successful had it
launched during a pandemic, but didn&rsquo;t cross the chasm
in 2014.</p>
