  <h1> Helpouts </h1>
  <p>Problem: How can Google literally connect a query to an expert?</p>
<p>Google helpouts was Google&rsquo;s attempt to turn video chat
into a business platform.  If a Google query for <em>How
to fix a toilet leak?</em> failed, it could connect you to
an actual human plumber who&rsquo;d talk to you and walk you
through the repair on a paid tutorial platform.</p>
<p>I worked on the android app, the internal stack serving
its API, integration with Google search, and the
referral system.</p>
<p>This project offered piano lessons, cooking, vacation
advice and medical services in one app.  All of this in
one UX was <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/02/15/helpouts-r-i-p-googles-build-it-and-they-will-come-approach-ultimately-failed-health-practitioners">too muddled</a> and new for both the
consumers and the providers.  <a href="https://www.onemedical.com">One-medical</a> is an
example of how to do this well in one vertical.</p>
<p>Despite these drawbacks, I suspect it would have
been wildly successful if launched during a pandemic.</p>
