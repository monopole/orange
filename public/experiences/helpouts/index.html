  <h1> Helpouts </h1>
  <p><a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-launches-helpouts-help-over-live-video-176039">Google Helpouts</a> was Google&rsquo;s attempt to turn
video chat into a small business platform.</p>
<p>I worked on the Android app and the Java-based REST API
it talked to, arranged for consumer and provider
notifications using Google infra, and did Google search
&ldquo;failed query&rdquo; integration that presented a Helpouts <a href="https://support.google.com/gsa/answer/6329232?hl=en">onebox</a>,
and did user studies at random locations in Palo Alto
to test our mobile UX.</p>
<p>This project offered piano lessons, cooking, vacation
advice and medical services in one app.  All this in
one UX was <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/02/15/helpouts-r-i-p-googles-build-it-and-they-will-come-approach-ultimately-failed-health-practitioners">too broad</a> and new for both consumers and
providers.  <a href="https://www.onemedical.com">One-medical</a> is an example of how to do
one vertical well.  It would have been wildly successful
had it launched during a pandemic, but didn&rsquo;t survive
in 2014.</p>
