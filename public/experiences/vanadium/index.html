  <h1> Vanadium </h1>
  <p>Problem: How can distributed servers find each other,
securely communicate, and delegate authority.</p>
<p>This project was a predecessor to <a href="https://kubernetes.io">kubernetes</a> and
Google fuchsia.</p>
<p>It required building libraries for service construction
and discovery, a <a href="https://grpc.io">grpc</a>-like service and protobuffer
language, and a wonderful model of delegatable
authorization based on public-key cryptography.</p>
<p>I contributed to the libraries and overall project
organization, wrote extensive, tested <a href="https://vanadium.github.io/tutorials/hello-world.html">tutorials</a>, and
built demos for android, ios and X11.</p>
<p>In particular, I wrote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk-5BkO_P14">volley</a>
(<a href="https://github.com/monopole/volley">code</a>), a distributed openGL app for
iOS, android, osX, X11 in Go that demonstrates
vanadium&rsquo;s cross platform power.</p>
<p>To test the tutorials I wrote a literate programming
system to read markdown, extract fenced code blocks,
execute them and report errors ([mdrip]).  mdrip is
used to test <a href="https://googlecontainertools.github.io/kpt">kpt</a>, [kustomize] and other tools.</p>
<p>Work was awarded with various internal mechanisms.</p>
<p>It was an honor to work with a team including Dave
Presotto and Ken Thompson, building the first large
system based on Pike&rsquo;s Go.</p>
<p>Investment in open-source Vanadium was halted in
favor of <a href="https://fuchsia.dev">fuchsia</a>.  I moved to terrabella.</p>
