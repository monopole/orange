  <h1> Vanadium </h1>
  <p><a href="http://v.io">Vanadium</a> lets distributed services find each other,
securely communicate, and delegate authority using
public-key cryptography.</p>
<p>I contributed to the Go libraries and overall project
organization, wrote extensive, tested <a href="https://vanadium.github.io/tutorials/hello-world.html">tutorials</a>, worked
closely with UX research to validate our material and built demos.
One such demo is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk-5BkO_P14">volley</a>,
a distributed OpenGL app for iOS, Android, OS X, and X11
(linux) written in Go that demonstrates vanadium&rsquo;s cross platform
power (<a href="https://github.com/monopole/volley">code</a>).</p>
<p>Vanadium and kubernetes (k8s) started about the same time,
approaching distributed computing from different directions.
K8s is a centrally controlled orchestration system that runs
existing software, while Vanadium is a set of libraries
and tools to build new microservices - on PC, mobile, and IoT,
that have no option other than to securely coordinate
with each other.  Vanadium baked strong crypto directly into
RPC and discovery, predating <a href="https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/">service mesh</a> concepts that
are add-ons to <a href="https://kubernetes.io">kubernetes</a>.  Google&rsquo;s investment into
V was halted in favor of <a href="https://fuchsia.dev">fuchsia</a> and k8s.</p>
