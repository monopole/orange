  <h1> Missle Defense UX </h1>
  <p>Managed team that built two cornerstone apps for the Reagan Test
Site. The first gathered sensor (radar, optical, etc.) data from
the network and presented it in ~30 different widgets (e.g.,
a radar bore-site view of incoming objects).
The second app was a simulator to drive the displays for training.</p>
<p>Set up iterative test and release cycles new to Lincoln.
New tested versions of the apps are deployed every two weeks to
the Reagan Test Site in Kwajalein, rather than once or twice a
year at unpredictable times.</p>
