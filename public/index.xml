      <title>Kustomize</title>

      <description>Kustomize is an open-source cluster configuration management tool for kubernetes.
I founded the project, guiding it from from nothing to 6500 github stars and over 100 contributors.
In kubernetes, one declares the state of all cluster objects in files, then applies those files to the cluster, where controllers drive objects to their newly desired states. To change the cluster one edits the files and reapplies them. This creates a new problem: how to manage these edits, how to manage hundreds if not thousands of cluster variants.</description>

      <description>Terra Bella (now Planet) is a satellite-based Earth imaging service.
I joined Terra Bella (formerly Skybox) after its acquisition by Google. I worked on a service that produced a satellite command stream based on constraints around imaging and communication opportunities. I also worked on orbitology software (orbit prediction from TLE), integrating it into Google systems. I worked to improve CI/CD, allow rollbacks, conduct post-mortems, etc.
Seeing SkySats 4-7 launch with the team, and later accept our commands, was a highlight.</description>

      <description>Vanadium lets distributed services find each other, securely communicate, and delegate authority using public-key cryptography.
I contributed to the libraries and overall project organization, wrote extensive, tested tutorials, worked closely with UX research, and built demos. One such demo is volley, a distributed OpenGL app for iOS, Android, OS X, and X11 (linux) written in Go that demonstrates vanadium&amp;rsquo;s cross platform power (code).
Investment into Vanadium was halted in favor of fuchsia.</description>

      <description>mdrip extracts and runs fenced code blocks from markdown, collecting output and reporting errors. This literate programming approach allows tutorials to be tested as part of CI/CD, or conversely, allows e2e tests to be framed as tutorials.
gorepomod helps one deploy multiple Go modules from one repository when the modules are interdependent.
gol_grid is my implementation of Conway&amp;rsquo;s game of life using flutter. Used to learn flutter&amp;rsquo;s BLoc pattern, and test mobile vs web performance of same code.</description>

      <description>Google Helpouts was Google&amp;rsquo;s attempt to turn video chat into a small business platform. If a Google query (fix a leaking toilet?) failed to offer quality results, Google could offer the user a chance to buy time with a human expert, anywhere in the world.
I worked on the Android app and the API it talked to, arranged for consumer and provider notifications, and did the Google search failed query integration.</description>

      <description>Google+ Games launched when FarmVille was in its prime.
I was TLM of the vertical, with 5-10 swes and interns, coordinating with extended team of dozens engaged in various aspects of G+ (stream, auth, privacy, and api).
We built the most complex part of the G+ web client, as it had to mitigate the risk of allowing 3rd party apps to run on Google domains. To do so, we launched the first aspect of the G+ API to games developers (contact sharing), preceding what came second (activity stream listing) by over a year.</description>

      <description>iGoogle was Google&amp;rsquo;s homepage, and Google&amp;rsquo;s first developer platform (gadget authoring).
I designed and built its gadget data sharing API (also Google&amp;rsquo;s first social API), and worked on its C++ stack.</description>

      <description>The Reagan Test Site in Kwajalein does e2e testing of missile defense systems.
I led a team building UX for the op center shown above. Dozens of Java SWT widgets (e.g., a radar bore-site view of incoming threats) displayed data from radar and optical sensors. We also built a simulator to drive the displays for training.
I introduced iterative test and release cycles to the group, moving from an unpredictable bi-yearly cycle to bi-weekly, increasing confidence in the ability to fix problems and ship features.</description>

      <description>Eidogen was a protein structure prediction startup. As second employee, I led the team that built eve, which still seems to be available. I based it on Java3d, which at the time was perfect for integrating large molecule static renders with a desktop app based on Swing.</description>
